# Soft-robotics-Gripper
The project focuses on the design and development of a soft robotic gripper inspired by
kirigami structures. It aims to address challenges in grasping delicate and deformable
objects, which is a significant problem in both industrial and medical robotics. Using finite element
analysis (FEA) and theoretical modeling, a kirigami-based soft gripper is designed, which is
scalable, modular, and capable of rapid and precise grasping. The gripperâ€™s design leverages the
mechanical properties of kirigami patterns to adapt to various object shapes and sizes.
